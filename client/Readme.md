This code is creating a chatbot. It imports two images, one for the user and one for the bot. It then uses query selector to get the form and chat container elements from the DOM. It then creates functions to handle loading, typing text, generating unique ids, and creating chat stripes. Finally it adds event listeners to the form so that when it is submitted or a key is pressed it will call the handleSubmit function which will fetch data from a server and display it in the chat container.
